### symfony

Symfony is a popular open-source PHP web application framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It was initially released in 2005 and has since become one of the most widely used PHP frameworks for building web applications, APIs, and microservices.

Symfony provides a robust set of tools and components that allow developers to quickly create and deploy high-quality web applications. Some of its key features include:

-> A modular architecture that makes it easy to extend and customize the framework
-> A powerful routing system for defining URL patterns and handling HTTP requests
-> An object-relational mapper (ORM) for working with databases
Built-in support for caching, security, and authentication
-> A templating engine for creating dynamic HTML pages
-> An extensive set of reusable components for common web development tasks
-> Symfony also has a strong and active community of developers, which means that there are many resources available for learning and getting help with the framework.
